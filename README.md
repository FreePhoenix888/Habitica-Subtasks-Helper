## Why do I need this app? ##
* Create task with subtasks from plain text. <br/>
  Let us imagine we have copied message with tasks from friend - `Clean PC, Update thermal grease, Add RAM` and the rest of the list. We do not want to separate this message ourselves, app provides the possibility to say<br/>*Separate my tasks! The separator is* `,`

* Create as many similar tasks as you want. Let us imagine we are going to praise themselves for every 5 pages of book we have read. We can create the task `Read 5 pages` multiple times
